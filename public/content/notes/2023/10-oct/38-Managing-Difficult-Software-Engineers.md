  - challenge regularly - push them out of their comfort zones
  - praise and recognition - show them milestones and publicly celebrate successes
  - constructive feedback and clear path - show them a path to success
- comfort - keep it comfortable
  - limit interruptions - embrace async comms
  - streamline processes
  - less thinking, more creating - focus their attention on a project

### Difficult Software Engineers
- the procrastinator
  - issues: delay important tasks, poor time mgmt or underestimate time required for projects
  - resolution: balance fairness and support - help prioritize tasks, set clear deadlines, offer time mgmt training
  - remember: goal is guide them to better habits, not micromanaging
- the lone wolf
  - issues: won't work well with others
  - resolution: embrace their way of working (not ideal unless they're really that good) or force them to collaborate
    - get them to share ideas in meetings, involve team in decisions more directly
    - assign a mentor to see themselves in a different light
- the negative nancy
  - issues: too much focus on negative aspects of solutions, resist change, spread negativity
  - resolutions: understand where they're coming from
    - be direct privately, ask them to bring solutions instead of problems 
    - encourage positive interactions
- the over-promiser
  - issue: overly optimistic, secretive when things don't go as planned
  - resolution: set realistic expectations together, make them accountable for deadlines
    - encourage early comms on issues they're seeing
- the know it all
  - issue: arrogant, close-minded, no one enjoys working with them
  - resolution: address directly in 1:1, emphasize mutual respect + open-mindedness
    - if behavior continues, give a formal warning and consider involving HR in the meeting
- the silent type
  - issue: keep thoughts to themselves
    - usually a product of a toxic culture where conflicts aren't resolved in a healthy way
  - resolution: recognize and value their contributions to make them feel more included
    - create inclusive + safe env for contributions
- the perfectionsist
  - issue: focus on minute details without seeing bigger picture, struggle to KISS + delegation
  - resolution: help them focus on what's important, prioritize simple solution w/ realistic standards
- the unreliable one
  - issue: usually late, unfinished work, poor commitment, discipline, or time management skills
  - resolution: set clear expectations + hold accountable
    - not handling this kind of person is a disservice to your team
- the conflict instigator
  - issue: argumentative, aggressive + disruptive
  - resolutions: address immediately in private, emphasize staying professional + zero-tolerance policy to behavior
- the burned-out employee
  - issue: exhausted, cynical, reduced professional efficacy
  - resolution: suggest vacation/sabbatical, support work/life balance

### Communication tips
- nonviolent communication
  - four steps
    - observation = state the facts we observe
    - feeling - share how we feel about what we observe
    - need - share what we need/value that is causing feelings
    - request - clearly request what we want without demanding it
- active listening and empathy
  - paraphrase, ask open-ended questions, show empathy
  - before you judge anyone, put yourself in their shoes and see from their side

### What to do next?
- Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)
  - only use after many 1:1s with no change in behavior
  - escalation tool to formalize employee performance problems
  - steps
    - clearly outline perf issues
    - set realistic + measurable goals
    - provide support/resources to help employee improve
    - monitor progress w/ regular feedback
  - PIP is not to punish, but to support to improve performance
- time to escalate
  - document the issue
  - follow org procedures
  - escalation is not your failure, it's a step to resolving an issue beyond your control
- time to part ways
  - termination to be considered only after repeated feedback, coaching, and support does not improve perf
  - process should be clear, fair and transparent
