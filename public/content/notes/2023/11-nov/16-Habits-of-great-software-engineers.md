- Focusing beyond the code
  - as a developer you will code 20% of your time. You should excel at coding nonetheless, but it won't be enough to be great.
- Efficiency / Antifragility
  — Making sure everything around you runs smoothly and has forward momentum
- Joy of tinkering 
  - build projects, try out frameworks, build stuff on the side. Keeps the spark alive.
- Knowing the why
  — It's important to know why your code does what it does, too many abstractions nowadays that rarely someone thinks below the level of their language e.g JS devs not thinking about the engine that runs their code.
  - advantages
    - problem solving - understanding underlying logic can help you towards an answer faster
    - informed decisions - deeper understanding equips a developer to make highly effective decisions
    - bridging gaps - grasping the broader landscape can foster better communication and collaboration
    - innovation - groundbreaking solutions emerge at the intersection of disciplines
- Thinking in systems
  — knowing how your code impacts not only your individual system but other parts of the business/application/life.
- Tech detox
  — Recharging away from your monitor makes you a better programmer.
- The art of approximation
  — Knowing important tech numbers to approximate calculations when making decisions when programming.
- transferring knowledge to other problems
  - find the essence of a problem, and apply it to other, similar problems
- making hard things easy
  - If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough
- playing the long game
  - understanding long-term tradeoffs of your choices
- developing a code nose
- strong opinions, loosely held
