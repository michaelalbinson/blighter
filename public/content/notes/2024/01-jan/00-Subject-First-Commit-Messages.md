Guidelines
- You don't always need a verb if you are introducing something new. For example, "Widget tests" is preferred over "Widget tests are added".
- We prefer to use "is corrected," rather than "is fixed". E.g., "Widget reconciliation is corrected"
- When something is refactored or improved in some way, we tend to use "is clarified". E.g., "Widget creation is clarified"
- When describing a rename, use "rather than". E.g., "Widget, rather than sprocket"
- When describing a version increase, be explicit about both the old and the new version. E.g., "Package version is increased from 1.1.1 to 1.2.0"
- Don't bother with the 50 character subject rule, make the first line as long as it needs to be. Brevity is useful, but 50 characters is too limiting in my experience.
