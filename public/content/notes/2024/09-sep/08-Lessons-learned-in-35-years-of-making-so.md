- do things in the most straightforward way possible
- there's no substitute for something working in prod
- relationships matter if you want to advance
- relationships matter if you want to see your vision come to life
- never be invisible
- build + maintain a network of people in your field outside the company you work for now
- be willing to learn
- chase adventure and interesting-ness, not salary/title
- challenge yourself to stretch past your natural tendencies
- understand different social classes have different ideas about how the world works
- when you deliver work you're really proud of, you've almost certainly done too much/taken too long
  - getting to 60-80% good-enough is the best outcome
- software you're building now will one day be decommissioned
