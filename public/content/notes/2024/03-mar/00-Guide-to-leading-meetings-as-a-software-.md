- Before the meeting:
  - Figure out the outcome you want to achieve by the end of the meeting
    - Invite the right people based on that outcome
    - make sure they know why they're invited
    - make sure they know what they need to prepare
  - Send a message or tag in the channel about the meeting invite and the purpose
    - Add a meeting description so everyone knows what it’s about
    - Start the meeting description with, “The goal of this meeting is…”
  - Use BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) to tell people upfront what you expect they come prepared with

  - Start the meeting off by reiterating the expected outcome and goal - get alignment
  - Respectfully keep the meeting on track pointing to the goal
  - Make sure everyone feels heard throughout the discussion
