### Startups: The good
- learning - it's an amazing place to learn
- impact - you have outsize impact on the company

### Startups: The bad
- financial risk - lower pay, rare to have bonuses, significant risk is inherent
- stress - focus on speed and execution, lots of context switching, constant time pressure

### Startups: the ugly
- failure - more often than not, startups fail

### Big tech: the good
- specialization - you can focus in on one technical area
- internal transfers - usually pretty easy
- financial stability/perks - build up a financial buffer here before going to a startup
- networking - easy to build a big network

### Big tech: the bad
- lack of purpose - reduced feeling of impact, changes take longer
- overhead/bureaucracy - orchestration between many teams is a pain

### Big tech: the ugly
- misaligned incentives in performance reviews

### Which is better?
- Spending time at a large company and a startup, is probably as good as it gets
