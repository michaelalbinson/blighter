- demise of the ok button
  - we used to have ok and cancel buttons on dialogs with clear implications on what happens when you use them
  - we've pivoted to just an X on modals (sometimes) where it's unclear what state you'll end up in if you click it
- fine mouse motor skills required
  - smaller areas for dragging and dropping app windows in OSes
- what app is this?
  - no clear indicators of what app you're in
- everything is gray now
  - visual indications of what is selected have faded over time
