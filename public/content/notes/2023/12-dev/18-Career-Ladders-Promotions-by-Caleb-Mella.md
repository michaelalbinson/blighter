TL;DR: covers characteristics of different engineering levels.I copied out the parts that are most relevant for me at this point, but good info for juniors in here too.

- Here are 7 characteristics that senior+/staff level engineers should be known for:
  - Ship and model the highest quality of work
  - Influence the org’s culture around best practices in testing, rollouts, monitoring, scaling, etc.
  - Spot pain points or weakness in technical or organizational systems and propose and lead solutions
  - Lead complex projects with clear deliverables and milestones that may span multiple years
  - Leverage cross-functional leaders in design, product, security, data science, to work towards team goals/projects
  - Give strong technical / business communication both oral and written
  - Provide mentoring, technical interviews, onboarding, documentation - things that help the team level up
- how to get to the next level
  - Operate at the next level in your head
  - Think through “what would I want to know if I was my manager?”
  - Rub shoulders with folks who are 1-2 levels above you
