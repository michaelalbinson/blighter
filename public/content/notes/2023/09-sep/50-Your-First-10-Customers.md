- If you build it, they will do absolutely nothing
  - you need to actively recruit your first customers
  - get to 10 customers
  - Why 10?
    - by the time you have 10 happy customers, it isnâ€™t a fluke anymore
    - you can use the nascent goodwill and referrals to further propel yourself
- how to find prospects
  - be scrappy with a spreadsheet to start
  - find places where customers congregate online
  - generally purchasing lists of leads will not return on the investment
- how determine if prospective customers are good or not
  - early adopters: sell it to someone that's bought similar things before
    - finding them: look for reference customers of firms that aren't competitors, but are lateral to you
  - on the internet: prioritize upwardly mobile firms + people with web presences
  - light sales cycles: good points of entry = $50-50k
  - intrinsically reachable: pick prospects that are easier to reach than others; e.g. service providers
- How should you communicate
  - most common: cold email to get on a phone call
    - keep these short + action oriented
  - prove you put in some work - get your salutation right, and show you know things about the prospect
  - start providing value: tell and show how your product is valuable
  - ask for a specific, small thing
- How should you follow-up
  - don't take no response for an answer, but don't be too pushy, and don't automate follow-ups, write them yourself
- What should you ask for on the call
  - instead of free trials, consider offering high-touch support for onboarding/integrating
  - 30 day money back guarantee can be a good approach too
- how can you get better over time
  - start codifying your process/building yourself a script
