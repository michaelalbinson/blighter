- Miserable managers have miserable reports
- Good engineering managers are force multipliers - they prevent:
  - Working on the wrong thing
  - Getting bogged down in arguments, or being endlessly indecisive
  - Waiting on other teams to do their work, waiting on code review
  - Ramping new engineers, or trying to support unfamiliar code
  - When people are upset, distracted, or unmotivated
  - Unfinished migrations, migrations in flight, or having to support multiple systems indefinitely
  - When production systems are poorly understood and opaque, quality suffers, and firefighting skyrockets
  - Terrible processes, tools, or calendars that don’t support focus time
  - People who refuse to talk to each other
  - Letting bad hires and chronic underperformers stick around indefinitely
- Why should you (or anyone) be a manager?
  - It gets you closer to how the business operates, and gives you a view into how and why decisions get made that translate eventually into the work you do as an engineer
  - if you feel the gravitational pull towards mentorship
  - build happy teams and propagate better practices through the industry
  - One way to develop a great staff engineer is to take a great senior engineer and put them through 2-3 years of management experience.
    - ^ divisive lol
- The kind of skills you learn in therapy, not in classes
  - Self-regulation
  - Self-awareness
  - Understanding other people
  - Setting good boundaries
  - Sensitivity to power dynamics
  - Hard conversations
  - The art of being on the same side
- One cautionary note
  - as a manager, don't work for a leadership team you don't respect or aren't aligned with
