- Ensuring Objectives actually describe an outcome.
- Use a ‘truth statement’ approach to writing objectives
  - i.e., describe the goal as if it’s true in the future.
- The Objective should not have a numerical component.
  - Save these for the key results
- Define key results as symptoms or evidence of achieving the objective.
- Focus: Have as few OKRs as possible
- OKRs align rather than cascade
  - with leadership/between teams (better method for setting high-level goals) 
- Pairing OKRs with a persistent model which includes longer-term goals linking up to the strategy and purpose of the organisation
- More explicitly reconcile work that brings about change and work that sustains an organisation.
