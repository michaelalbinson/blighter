- STEP 1: START WITH A CULTURAL SHIFT
  - default is that companies under-resource documentation efforts 
  - Model good writing habits
    - you can’t have a strong documentation culture without a strong writing culture
    - good habits
      - recap regularly
      - get existential
    - get in the habit of editing
  - Make writing a part of the job ladder
  - Shine a spotlight on docs, even outside of performance review season
  - Carve out the time to work on docs (doc bashes)
- STEP 2: GET STARTED PAYING DOWN YOUR DOCS DEBT WITH A MVP APPROACH.
  - Try to identify the top five to 10 technical topics that engineers are struggling with the most and invest in those
  - Focus on quality, not quantity to set the bar.
  - have code style guides
  - create a glossary of technical terminology
  - act as a journalist - investigate and document the what and why
  - empower senior engineers to write docs
- STEP 3: STOP THE RANDOM ACTS OF DOCUMENTATION AND GET ORGANIZED.
  - Assemble your list - put important docs you have in a spreadsheet
    - cheap way - look for the top 50 most popular documents
  - types of docs
    - onboarding
    - task-based
    - runbooks
    - arch/design docs
    - wiki-style team docs
  - Identify ownership.
  - Assign a rotating docs czar.
  - Don’t be afraid to delete.
  - Level up with landing pages.
- STEP 4: BRING DOCS INTO THE DEV CYCLE — DON’T WAIT FOR CODE-COMPLETE.
  - Take "snapshots" as you go
    - iterative drafts of documentation work great as friction logs
- WRAPPING UP: JUST GET STARTED.
