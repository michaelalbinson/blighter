- Use consistent standards 
  - Every outperformer I knew had the style guide internalized and followed it as closely as possible, knowing its benefits.
- Write aesthetic, simple code
- Don’t allow surprises
  - Good code is predictable.
  - use SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion)
  - Tests should be simple. It should be easy to identify what went wrong when reading a failing test.
- Communicate often
  - The best engineers were both communicative and collaborative - not afraid to take the time to work together for the chance at a better end result.
- Detach from the code itself
  - in 20 years, there’s a high chance that much of your code will either be technical debt, deprecated, or rewritten.
- Code fast… and slow
  - By taking the time to use standards, test properly, use principles, and communicate often, they save themselves more time in the long run.
- Code for the human, not the computer
  - Code is for the engineers on your team AND code is for the end user
  - The best engineers I knew always evaluated the value of their code, for all audiences.
- Don’t follow rules blindly
  - The above “rules” and “principles” are simply guidelines. 

- other things they did:
  - had deep domain knowledge in at least one field
  - marketed themselves often and appropriately and worked on high-impact projects

Takeaway:
- Good code is consistent, clean, understandable, testable, and valuable
