- “Someone should do the estimations, so the team can work uninterrupted.”
  - Estimations done as a team improves information sharing and creates a better understanding of the tasks ahead
- “Story points are so arbitrary, just estimate in man-hours instead.”
  - Story points are not arbitrary, life is.
  - “Story points are independent of time.”
    - Story points stand for the size of the task, regardless of its nature
  - story size = team velocity × development time
- “I think this is a 5 SP task, moving on…”
  - When estimating, the goal is to find a common understanding of our future tasks so our estimates can be more precise
  - Every 5 minutes spent on discussion can save 1 hour on development
- “Scrum poker is a waste of time!”
  - A well-mediated estimation can reveal important aspects from anyone in the team
