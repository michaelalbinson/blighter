- Setting goals is just about being intentional about your ideal future. 
- Goals allow you to be intentional about the tradeoff decision and say “no” rather than being overloaded by an infinite amount of tasks
- different types of goals
  - Objective not 100% within your control: e.g. “Be promoted to Senior Engineer”
  - Objective 100% within your control: e.g. “Exhibit the behaviors of a Senior Engineer”
  - Action-based checklist: e.g. “Read 25 books in 2024” or “Do 3 database courses”
  - Recurring pattern: e.g. “I want to read 1 hour per day”
  - Feeling: e.g. “I want to feel more confident at public speaking.”
  - There’s no right or wrong on which of these to use
- deciding on your goals
  - Start with focus areas
  - which areas of your life you want to improve
    - examples
      - Personal growth
      - Travel & Fun
      - Health
      - Side Hustle
  - Ask yourself what you want to celebrate
    - Non-SMART goal: Make more friends this year
    - SMART goal: Make at least 5 new friends this year that I can invite over
  - Answer your “why”
    - know why it’s important to you to complete a goal
- How to achieve your goals
  - Success = Goals + Systems to achieve those goals
  - break down, break down, break down
    - Start with annual goals, then break them into quarterly goals, then for each quarterly goal, create action items for that quarter. 
  - add as much or as little structure as it makes sense for you
  - Too much structure could add stress and reduce flexibility
- You need a system to check in on your progress
  - a digital checklist can be helpful here
