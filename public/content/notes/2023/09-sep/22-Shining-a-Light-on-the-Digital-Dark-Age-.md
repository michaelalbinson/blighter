TL;DR: larger discussion of data preservation for humanity, not super relevant to work.

Premise: Without maintenance, most digital information will be lost quickly. How should we 
secure our data so that it survives for generations? 

- obstacles to data preservation:
  - hardware longevity
  - format accessibility
  - comprehensability
  - obstacles are compounded by encryption and abundance
- durability of the web is not guaranteed
  - e.g. Link rot (where outdated links lead readers to dead content)
- Internet archive - 99 petabytes of disk space + a redundant backup
- WORM media can help here too (Write Once, Read Many)
