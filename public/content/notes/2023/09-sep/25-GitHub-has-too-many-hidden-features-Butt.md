TL;DR: obscure github tips and tricks - not super relevant for me

- on a repo page hit `.` and you'll open an online VSCode instance on `github.dev` to do dev work online
- Profile > feature preview for experimental things
- you can use regexes in search if you use regex syntax, e.g. `/slashes/. /^hash.?map/ ` matches has
  - can also search ranges in metadata
- press y to change the url from branch-based to commit-based
- commenting on a PR and put a backtick-codeblock labelled suggestion in the comment, it'll show it as a line change
- there's an online graphql IDE for github graphql - https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer
