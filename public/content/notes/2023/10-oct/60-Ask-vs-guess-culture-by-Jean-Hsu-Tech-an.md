- Ask culture expectations
  - Ask for what you want, even if it seems out of reach or like a big unreasonable request
  - Take care of your own needs, and others will take care of theirs
  - It’s fine to make requests that people will probably say no to
  - People say yes to requests that they truly feel good about, say no to ones they don’t
- Guess culture expectations
  - Only ask for something if you’re already pretty sure the other person will say yes
  - Read an abundance of indirect contextual cues to determine if your request is reasonable to make
  - It’s rude to put someone in a position where they have to say no to you
  - If the appropriate feelers and context are set, you will never have to make your request at all.
- navigating the corporate world as a "guess" culture person
  - Ask for help on something you’re feeling stuck on
  - Ask to publish something on the company blog or give a talk at an upcoming event
  - Get more comfortable with people saying no to you
  - If people are not saying no to you, you’re probably still only asking for things that you already know people will say yes to
  - Ask yourself, “If I could have my way…”, which is a useful hack to bypass thinking about others’ needs and honing in on exactly what you want
    - Use this to think about your role, your next project, your work schedule, your title, your salary and equity, your team
