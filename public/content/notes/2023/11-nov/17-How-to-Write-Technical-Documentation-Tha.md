- what is technical documentation
  - written description of whatever youâ€™ve worked on, with instructions on how to use it
- why are good docs important?
  - reader's guide to the product, why it's important
  - w/o docs, readers will not be able to use your product to its fullest potential
- when is the right time to write docs
  - _not_ the end of the project
    - will lead to weaker documentation that is further removed from the implementation
  - document as you go along, step by step
- difference between good and bad docs
  - bad - instructions that are more frustrating than helpful
  - good docs guides you without being condescending
- how to write good docs
  - write for your audience's level
  - use modular documentation - cross linking between more and less granular docs
  - have it (peer-)reviewed
