-----------------------

- If you do Google the question beforehand, delete your tracks afterwards
  - you can, but will get ding'd if noticed
- set up a basic program and make sure you can run it
  - don't waste time early with a broken environment
- keep your personal intro short - tech interviews access experience and goals primarily
- ask how much time you have to answer the question
- when you get the question
  - restate the q briefly
  - ask a clarifying questions or two
  - ask how you'll be assessed - it answers:
    - how far am I supposed to get?
    - are we looking for efficient code, clean code or both
    - should you write tests
  - sketch a solution around a base case
- run your code frequently
- use hypotheses to debug - and tell the interviewer what it is
- common mistakes
  - forgetting to save files
  - trying to read input from the wrong location
  - not knowing if a method mutates its input or returns new output
- consider asking for help
- don't badmouth languages/libraries/anything else
- talk as much as you reasonably can
- don't define a bunch of stuff until you're sure it's a good idea
  - don't abstract too soon
- use TODOs
- write tests
  - don't use a testing framework unless you're very confident in it (I disagree with this point)
  - if a test passes, print pass
  - if all tests pass first time, try to make them fil
  - don't do TDD unless you find it helpful
  - keep your tests
