- What is Docs-as-code?
  - goal: make the work of authoring, versioning, reviewing and publishing documentation smoother, more efficient, repeatable and reliable
  - principles:
    - docs is a first-class citizen in the SDLC
    - docs should be versioned and stored in source control repositories such as Git
      - docs should be written in plain-text formats like Markdown, to support versioning and collaboration
    - docs should be reviewed and tested before being published
    - workflow should be automated where possible to improve reliability and user experience of publishing sites
- CI for docs
  - check for broken links
  - check static assets
