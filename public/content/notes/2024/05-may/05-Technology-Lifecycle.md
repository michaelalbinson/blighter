- Goals of a technology lifecycle
  - standardization - of comms and lifecycle plans (e.g. decomissioning plans)
  - clarity - need transparency on status of a technology at slack
  - autonomy and control - allow easier retirement of a technology
- lifecycle - things to document at each stage
  - acceptance of new customers (can I use it yet?)
  - feature requests (do we accept them, how are they prioritized?)
  - bug reports (do we accept them, how are they prioritized?)
  - security and compliance reports (do we accept them?)
  - doc quality (how up to date and accurate are docs)
  - lifecycle progression rules (active systems never go straight to retired)
- lifecycle stages
  - alpha - don't use it yet (an experiment)
  - beta - this will become active, but it's not ready for wide use
  - active - production ready, has staffed support
  - maintainance - replacement is coming (and is in late beta)
  - deprecated - there is a feature-complete active alternative
  - retired - no longer supported, do not use
