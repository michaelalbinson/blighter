Michael note: feels like they exclude express as a more real comparator to django, this isn't a deeply technical guide


- Setup
  - Django is quick with pip: `pip install django` then create a new project with `django-admin startproject projectname`
  - Node.js: `npm init`
- Core features/benefits
  - Django: batteries-included philosophy - highlight: included ORM framework
  - Node.js: event-driven non-blocking I/O model
    - node has higher scalability + better community support
- Performance: Node is faster
- Real use cases:
  - Django: e-commerce
  - Node: Real-time data applications
