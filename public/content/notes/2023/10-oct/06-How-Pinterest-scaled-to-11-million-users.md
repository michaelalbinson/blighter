### Lessons
- Use known, proven technologies. Pinterest’s dive into newer technologies at the time led to issues like data corruption.
- Keep it simple. (A recurring theme!)
- Don’t get too creative. The team settled on an architecture where they could add more of the same nodes to scale.
- Limit your options.
- Sharding databases > clustering. It reduced data transfer across nodes, which was a good thing.
- Have fun! New engineers should contribute code in their first week.
