Tl;dr: kinda interesting approach to frontends where they fully segment pages into individual frontends. I get it, but it sounds like a bad idea lol.

- architectural and organizational style for splitting frontend services based on bxackend microservices
- Domain-driven design (DDD) is the key principle - each Micro Frontend represents a business sub-domain
- 3 principles of Micro Frontend are:
  - Model around the business domain
  - Decentralization via autonomous teams
  - Automation culture for deployment
- common anti-patterns in Micro Frontends are:
  - Not setting boundaries properly and creating many Micro Frontends
  - Increased complexity by using many frameworks and tools
  - Dependency hell in Micro Frontends
