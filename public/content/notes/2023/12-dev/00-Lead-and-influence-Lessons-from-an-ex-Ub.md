### Tl;DR
- Why you should put your energy into being a leader
  - It exposes you to more opportunities and helps you get promoted faster
  - It levels up your team, allowing you to achieve more with less stress.
- How you can show you’re a leader
  - Step out of your box. Do what a leader would do. Not just what your role says you should do.
  - When you can’t solve every problem, show the way and push for it. You don’t need to do everything. You can facilitate the improvements over time though.
  - Disagreements don’t mean always getting your way. It means working toward a solution together that solves a mutual problem for both of you.
  - Don’t be afraid to ask the hard questions. But also ask respectfully. One good way is to convert your “Why” questions to “What” questions.

  - Engage and inspire others, collaborate
- Implementing the solution
  - What needs to happen for the problem to be solved?
  - Who needs to buy in?
  - What resources are needed?
- Lessons
  - What can be done for similar problems to be prevented in the future?
