Tips:

- Optimize images and assets:
  - Large images can slow down your extension. Compress images and use formats like WebP. Implement lazy loading to load images only when needed.
- Speed up server requests:
  - Slow server requests can be a performance bottleneck. Use caching, CDNs, and browser caching. Minimize unnecessary API calls by toring data locally.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders:
  - Prevent components from re-rendering when data hasn't changed. Use techniques like useEvent, useMemo and React.memo in React to optimize rendering.
- Optimize data storage:
  - Choose the right data storage method. IndexedDB is great for storing large data sets in the browser. Manage data efficiently and plan for offline access and synchronization.
- Focus on user experience:
  - Speed should improve the user experience. Test with users and gather feedback to identify areas for improvement. Prioritize a smooth and responsive interface.
- Keep an eye on memory usage:
  - High memory usage can slow down your extension and the browser. Keep an eye on memory consumption and optimize your code to reduce unnecessary memory use.
