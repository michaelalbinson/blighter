### recruiting and hiring
- continuously evolve your process

  - Build consistency into your recruiting process to ensure efficiency and fairness.
  - Never lose sight of candidate experience: No matter the outcome, you should leave a positive impression of your company and team.
  - Revisit your recruiting process on a regular basis to measure progress and make changes as needed.
