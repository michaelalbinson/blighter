- anytime rules are applied too universally it becomes an anti=pattern
- unexpected anti-patterns
  - #1 shying away from micromanagement
    - 3 hats to wear for tech execs
      - exec team member - drive the business forward
      - eng manager - find structure of policies needed to run an engineering org
      - engineer - you need to be engaged with keeping technical excellence bar high
    - micromanagement can be ok to stay engaged with context of the engineering org
    - stay in the loop with the state of the code
    - tactics to stay engaged
      - get up to speed by conflict mining - have a bunch of conversations about pain points
        - successful leaders ask how can I change myself to fit
        - not how do I force the engineering org to change
      - write down details
        - building a culture of documentation is essential to unlocking fast-moving engineering
        - get your shover and go digging - you should lead by example
          - talk to longtime employees
        - use other companies' success as a benchmark
        - strategy doc should cover
          - what's the diagnosis (current state)
          - what are the guiding principles?
          - what's the coherent action
  - #2 pushing back on measuring flawed metrics
    - getting stuck trying to find the right thing to measure slows you down
    - focus on improving mental models - is the metric you're tracking useful? great, it doesn't need to be perfrect
    - pull the ceo into the details and educate them there
  - #3 serving as an umbrella for your team
    - protecting your team from reality just makes things worse for them in the long term
    - common approaches
      - bottom-up strategy - (hands off approach to management)
      - top-down strategy - It's rarely true that a committee gets the best decision, though the upside is it does at least bring all the context into the room
    - use navigators to speed up decision making - one person per BU that acts as a mini-CTO
    - other related lessons
      - don't skip docs
      - do post-mortems
      - be intentional who you put you conviction in
