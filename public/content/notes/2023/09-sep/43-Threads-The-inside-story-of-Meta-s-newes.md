- planning and development
  - startup environment
    - people working fast + independently
    - daily burndown syncs
  - python (django) backend
    - reused a good deal of the instagram backend models/business logic/security/infrastructure
  - swift (for iOS) + jetpack compose (android) for mobile
  - MVP was very tightly scoped
- launch
- the future is decentralied
  - threads works with federated socials like mastodon + activitypub
- code wins arguments
  - completed the technical work for a new app in five months
  - given the freedom to operate in a completely greenfield space
  - got to prototype and get feedback quickly
  - if we tested a feature and didn’t like it, we rebuilt it until we landed on the best version
