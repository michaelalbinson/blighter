- ❓What is Feedback and why it’s important
  - 🛠️ Quality and Precision: continuous feedback ensures high standards in engineering work through timely identification and bug fixes.
  - 📊 Data-Driven Decisions: exchanging feedback helps in making informed decisions based on data and performance metrics.
  - 🔄 Agile Methodologies: it supports agile practices, essential for iterative development and rapid response to change (think about retrospectives).
  - 👥 Team Collaboration: promotes effective communication and collaboration, essential for complex engineering tasks.
  - 🔄 Continuous Improvement: facilitates ongoing development of skills and processes, keeping the team innovative and competitive.
  - 🚀 Rapid Problem-Solving: enables quick identification and resolution of technical issues, crucial in fast-paced IT environments.
  - 🛡️ Risk Management: identifies potential risks in IT projects early, allowing for proactive measures and solutions.
  - 📚 Knowledge Sharing: fosters a culture of learning and knowledge exchange, crucial for keeping up with evolving IT trends.

- 💡 Tips to make your feedback effective
  - 💭 Mindset: as I already mentioned, feedback is not something negative. In particular if you are in the EM or leader position, start spreading this culture.
  - 📝 Write down your process: as I just did some paragraphs above, writing down your process when you have to give important feedback, can help better visualize the situation.
  - 🤖 Use AI to tune your feedback: one thing where AI imho is great, is in setting the tone. Especially if you have to give the feedback in your non-native language, asking ChatGPT to check your tone can be very helpful. I also created a GPT for this 🙂
  - 🥪 No sandwiches: as I mentioned, keep celebration and feedback separated. This has two benefits. It will make the celebration more meaningful and it will ensure clarity in your feedback.
  - 🔍 Give feedback when you see patterns: taking the previous example, it’s frustrating if people are late, but it can happen for various reasons. Before giving the feedback, ensure the behavior is repetitive.
  - 🗣️ Ask for feedback: as we saw, feedback is a two-way transaction. After giving feedback, ask for it too.
