things I think are worth striving towards on this list:
- exceptionally clear writing
- fast when it matters, slow when it doesn’t
- deliver on an agreed schedule, even if it means getting best effort rather than the perfect thing
- figure out assignments from people they respect on their own and deliver way above expectations on them
- keep promises
- ask questions that make people they talk to smarter and more specific
  - impatient yet patient; brilliant yet dumb
- do what’s required to get where they want to get (rather than only doing what they’re good at)
- delivered a ton of interesting projects that weren’t helpful for anything in particular
- actions reflect beliefs
- have a history of embarrassing cold emails
- use first principles when there are no priors & use priors when there are priors
- curious
