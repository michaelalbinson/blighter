- The Efficient Security Principle
  - The security baseline of a offering/system faces continuous downward pressure from customer excitement about, or reliance on, the offering in question.
  - The baseline for an offering’s security will be set at the point at which people will not stop using the offering because it’s insecure.
  - The better the offering is, the lower the security baseline can be without losing customers.
- we know something has the “right” amount of security
  - the bar for acceptable, not ethically or morally, is when people just keep using it
  - We use these things because the value they provide outweighs the security risks in our minds.
- progress is possible
  - particularly with policy/regulatory changes
  - mostly it comes slowly over time OR
  - in jumps because of security incidents
  - yelling about the problem rarely yields change
- how to use this principle
  - absorb this truth so their mental health and job satisfaction don’t suffer unnecessarily
