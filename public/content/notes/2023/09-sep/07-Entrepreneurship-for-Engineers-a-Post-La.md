Things to consider before starting a startup:
- Check Your Bank Balance: If you're considering building a product company, you may need some savings or a generous severance package to fall back on. Selling services immediately can help generate cash flow.
  - you can start with a consulting or freelance business and work on the product on the side
- Take Your Time: 
  - it's important to reset and figure out what you want to do before diving into something new
  - first figure out what you would be interested in building
- Start with an MVP
  - Donâ€™t wait until your product is perfected to introduce it to potential customers
- Stick with It, but Be Prepared to Pivot: 
  - Sometimes an idea just isn't good, so it's important to recognize when to pivot and move on.
- Move into a Leadership Mindset: As the company evolves, you need to learn how to navigate a board of directors and investors, and figure out your own values and leadership style.
