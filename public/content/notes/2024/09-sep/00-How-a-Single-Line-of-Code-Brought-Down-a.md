- Implement proper error handling
  - Design your systems with the assumption that components will fail. Implement redundancies, cross-checks, and fail-safe mechanisms.
- Focus on user
  - Ensure that your systems communicate clearly with their users, especially about their current state and any automated actions. Provide users with the information and controls they need to make informed decisions and override automated systems when necessary.
- Prioritize integration testing
  - While unit tests are crucial, they're not enough. Invest time and resources in comprehensive, system-wide integration testing. Test edge cases and failure modes.
- Cultivate a culture of open communication
  - Create an environment where concerns can be raised without fear and near misses are seen as valuable learning opportunities rather than embarrassing ones to be swept under the rug.
- Advocate for proper resource allocation
  - As software engineers, we advocate for the resources to do our jobs properly. This includes pushing back against unrealistic deadlines, insufficient testing time, or cost-cutting measures that could compromise safety
