### What is zero trust
- every user/device/app, regardless of their position relative to the network boundary, undergoes stringent authC, authZ, and ongoing verification before gaining access to resources
- elements
  - continuous monitoring - of network traffic/user conduct/status of devices
  - encryption - protect data in transit and at rest
  - identity and access management (IAM) - least privilege access rights
  - micro-segmentation - subdivide network into isolated segments
  - Multi-factor authC (MFA)
  - policy enforcement - establish/maintain protocols/controls to govern data access
  - visibility and analytics

### The Benefits of Zero Trust
- improved security/data safety
- early threat detection
- mitigation of insider threats
- flexibility
- improved regulatory alignment
- optimized remote work protection

### Seven Pillars of Zero Trust
- workforce security - access controls policies/authC before granting network access
- device security - identify and authZ devices
- workload integrity - secure apps and digital processes
- network security
- data security in Zero trust
- visibility and analytics enhancement
- automation and orchestration optimization

### Zero trust maturity model
- guide for enterprises transitioning to the contemporary Zero Trust method
- operates on premise a breach has already occurred in your network
- mandates validations for any action that could pose a threat inside the network

### The 5 Pillars of the Zero Trust Maturity Model
- identity
- devices
- networks
- apps + workloads
- data

### Benefits of the Zero Trust Maturity Model
- alignment with an organization’s security measures to counteract threats prevalent in today’s cybercrime landscape
- ZTMM provide multi-layered defenses against harmful cyberattacks, data breaches, and information losses
