- Why Do Estimations at All?
  - Resource Allocation: prevent over or under allocation
  - Collaboration: build shared expectations in team about timelines
  - Sanity Check: maintains a semblance of sanity in the face of constant deadlines and deliverables
- Estimations in Software Projects
  - No two projects are the same
  - Uncertainty is your constant companion: ensure your estimations have some buffer for the “human factor” - I usually add 20-25%
  - Communication is king: better to over-communicate than to expect people to communicate with you first
- Wrong Ways to Do Estimations
  - The blind guess
  - The "one size fits all" approach
  - Ignoring external factors
  - The fixed mindset: don't allow the timeline to become set in stone
- Proper Ways to Estimate
  - Break tasks down into manageable units
  - Use historical data and experience
  - Employ estimation techniques: (e.g. Planning Poker or Wideband Delphi)
  - Factor in uncertainty with ranged estimates
  - Seek out mentorship and guidance
  - Don’t get influenced by authority
- Refining Estimates
  - Track progress and compare to initial estimates
  - Revisit estimations during project milestones
  - Communicate changes to stakeholders
- Helping Your Manager Plan Better
  - Be proactive in communication
  - Share your expertise and insights
  - Collaborate on risk management
  - Be flexible and adaptable
- Work Culture Affects Estimations Accuracy
  - encourage others to ask questions and clarify requirements
  - Emphasis on continuous improvement
  - Openness to experimentation and adaptation
  - Support for collaboration and teamwork
- Advice going forward - TL;DR:
  - Always be estimating.
  - You’ll be wrong most of the time until you get good. And then you’ll still be wrong sometimes.
  - Group estimates are more accurate than your single estimate.
  - Embrace a growth mindset and be open to feedback and continuous improvement.
  - Communicate effectively with your manager and collaborate with your team to ensure everyone is on the same page.
  - Be adaptable and willing to experiment with new techniques and methodologies.
  - Consider the impact of work culture on estimation accuracy and seek out environments that support your growth.
