- Don’t let designers dictate to engineers
  - Over indexing on design polish reduces speed 
  - The best engineers want freedom (and will probably quit if they don’t get it)
  - engineers can design the UX of a product (sometimes)
- Product engineers > Product managers
  - their engineers:
    - talk to users
    - decide what to build
    - pitch new products to extend the platform
  - management makes clear what they're trying to build via a clear mission + strategy
  - teams share their success metrics + goals
- hire for autonomy
  - hire people who can have big impact while working mostly autonomously
- create mini-startup teams which:
  - own their pricing
  - make their own product decisions
  - have access to the revenue/hosting/staff costs for their product
  - are responsable for coordinating with marketing/growth teams
- prioritize hiring builders over non-builders
- adopt the makers schedule
  - shorten/eliminate meetings where you can
- trust + feedback over process
