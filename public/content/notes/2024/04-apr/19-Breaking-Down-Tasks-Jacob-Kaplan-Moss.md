- start with a high level sketch/idea
- break down to a list of tasks
- think through the steps required to accomplish each task + write them down
- decide if items are sufficiently defined
  - do I understand what change is desired
  - do I know what done looks like
  - can I define all the steps needed to get to done
  - assume no blockers/dependencies, do I have the info I need to start the task now?
  - if any answer is no, take that task and break it down into smaller pieces
- repeat until all tasks are sufficiently broken down
