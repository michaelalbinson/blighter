### Intro
- schedules for EMs tend to be tightly structured

### Routines
- routines are important because:
  - consistency - helps to develop good habits
  - time management - set aside time for repetitive tasks that help keep you organized and prepared
  - stress reduction - good habits create boundaries between work and personal life

#### Warm up routines
- quick review of calendar
- check email, messages for urgent matters
- reserve a few minutes for self reflection - what are your goals for the day?
- stay up to date reading relevant news sources

#### Cool-down routines
- review what you've accomplished, what needs attention
- organize tasks + priorities for tomorrow
- do a relaxing activity/engage with people you care about

#### Breaks
- breaks are important for
  - recharging, reflection and connecting
- also help build structure into your day


### Meetings
#### 1:1s
- scheduling all on the same days helps with two things:
  - connect the dots in what team members share with you
  - helps create days without meetings
- journaling after 1:1s can help to debrief yourself

#### Standups
- over time daily standups can feel redundant
  - standups 2-3 times a week seem to be ideal

#### All-Hands
- as a director they did weekly all hands to broadcast things
- (IMO: less frequent is probably better)

### Hiring
- interviews - do interviews to determine tech skills and culture fit
- selection - collaborate with team and HR to pick the best candidates
- onboarding - ensure smooth onboarding, help integrate them into the team

### No Meeting Days
- important generally for focus time

### Focused Work
- code reviews
- dealing with tech requirements
- updating documentation
- contributing to small coding projects
- conducting market research
- preparing presentation
- etc

### Learning
- read industry news
- take online courses
- peer networking
