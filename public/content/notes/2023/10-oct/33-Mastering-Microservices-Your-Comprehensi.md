### Benefits of microservices
- scalability - easy to scale individual services based on traffic/usage
- agility - faster dev/updates/deploys
- flexibility - allows teams to choose diverse tech stacks
- fault isolation - failures isolated to service level
- team autonomy - empowers small teams
- high availability - increases fault tolerance
- incremental updates - independent feature releases
- hybrid cloud/multi cloud envs - you can deploy anywhere

### When not to use microservices
- simple apps
- limited (eng) resources
- data-intensive apps
  - microservices make it hard to maintain data consistency

### Challenges
- Increased Complexity
- Resources Overhead
- Tooling Monitoring
- Documentations and Communications
- Cost Management
- Learning Curve
- Versioning
- Service Coordination
- Data Management
