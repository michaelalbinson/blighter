1. don't ask about requirements
2. trying to build a perfect design
  - didn't identify trade-offs or bottlenecks/single points of failure
3. not showcasing the knowledge relevant to the interview
  - ask the interviewer if you should go a particular direction
  - e.g. don't dig into capacity planning unless the interviewer wants to see that
4. monologuing
  - fix: have a conversation with your interviewer
5. using buzzwords
  - fix: refer to proven technologies
6. not managing time
  - fix: do mock interviews, manage time in interview by setting guideline times
7. Don't Validate Design
   - fix: mention cross-cutting concerns, ask interviewer if you're meeting the requirements (towards end of interview)
