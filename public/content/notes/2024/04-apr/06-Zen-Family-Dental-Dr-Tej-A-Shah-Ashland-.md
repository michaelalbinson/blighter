- Dx Skills > Tx Skills
  - value the ability to diagnose (Dx) more than their ability to simply treat (Tx)
  - when interviewing - ask to figure out why a bug is happening
- Make your customers consent to really bad ideas
- Replace (some) meetings with quizzes
  - Often, a meeting is scheduled to make sure everybody to be on the same page
  - mandatory, short quiz - more likely to ensure they actually read the presentation/doc
- assume your colleague is competent and the environment was unusual before making judgments
- better to talk to people who use the product than those who made the product
