TL;DR: SWE workflow tips - preferences of a single person, but a good core idea: "Optimize the 
tasks you do every day, multiple times per day."

### Git/terminal workflow
- autocomplete past commands
  - suggests using `iterm2`/`zsh`/`starship` (starship not needed)
- aliases for commands

```bash
# make it easy to add and load in new aliases
alias addalias='code ~/.zshrc' <-- open up zshrc file to edit it
alias reload='source ~/.zshrc' <-- reload zshrc file to apply changes
```

- easily manage git files
  - SCM breeze can make it a bit more convenient to interact with git from the command line https://github.com/scmbreeze/scm_breeze

### Coding
- tracing source
  - Jetbrains: `cmd + b` on method/variable/class
- naviagting between locations
  - use keyboard to navigate file history - Jetbrains: `cmd + opt + <arrow_key_>`
- typing
  - use copilot

### Save learnings
- Have a "second brain" in your notes
  - save notes where you will use them, not where you learned them

### Offloading ideas + tasks
- don't use brain to store ideas
  - TODOist + slack "save for later" ASAP to get it out of your brain
- let your brain focus on solving problems, not remembering everything


### communicating through visuals
- some places where you could do this:
  - Documenting a pull request
  - Sending a Slack message explaining a change you want to make to a PM
  - Getting approval or sign-off on screenshots for a new flow you built
- Find a screenshot tool you like/take videos->GIFs to simplify demos

### Signing into things
- use a password manager, dummy it's (a) convenient, (b) more secure

### Window management
- use a window management too (BTT FTW)
