- what is an RFC
  - purpose is to find the best way to solve a problem before the implementation starts
- when should I write an RFC, and when should I skip
  - bugs/simple features don't need one
  - new concepts, multi-month projects could always use one
  - litmus test:
    - Is there more than one obvious way to implement this feature?
    - Is there a new library/service we have to pick?
- why use an RFC?
  - You will organize your thoughts and get clarity
  - You will learn more
  - You will crowdsource your team‚Äôs knowledge
  - You will advance your team‚Äôs understanding of the codebase
  - PR reviews will go much smoother
  - Your documentation is already 50% done
- how to write one
  - include
    - metadata (Title, date, reviewers, etc)
    - problem/goal
      - The better you define the problem or the goal/feature you need to implement, and why you need to do it the easier your life will be
      - include: high level summary, context, problem/goal, extra details, non-goals
    - proposed solution
      - write pseudocode, find out how others are doing it
    - implementation overview
    - remarks/open questions
