Exceptional startups have:
- Exceptional CEO
  - clear track record of outlier success
  - clarity of thought 
- Exceptional executive team
  - “how do I know if this CEO is exceptional?” - judge them by their team
- Exceptional investors
- Exceptional high talent bar which leads to exceptional talent density
  - Are they slow? Weird? Not impressive? Really concerned with work life balance? Then you should probably not work there.
    - :oh-no:
- Exceptional product with exceptionally happy customers
