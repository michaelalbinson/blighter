- There’s no time like now - while young it's easier to learn quickly
- maximal learning is often at the point of significant pain
  - grit, and its close cousin, resilience, are essential for taking your intelligence further than it can get on its own
  - choosing grit over the allure of a predictable pace
- you still need to hold a pace that is sustainable
- complete self-motivation is incredibly rare
  - where will you find inspiration amongst your team?
- you can find your zen in stressful, chaotic times
  - Not having time to waste requires you to focus on the essentials and develop an innate sense of direction
- At the limit, you probably should care about work-life balance
  - find the thing that motivates you, work your ass off, learn as much as you can, and trust that today’s gains will compound well into the future
- Working your ass off isn’t bleak – it’s quite the opposite
  - sprinting at an unsustainable pace is an act of tremendous optimism
