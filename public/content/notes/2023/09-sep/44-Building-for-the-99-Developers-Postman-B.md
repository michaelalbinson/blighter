-----------------------

- tech buzz doesn't reflect the daily reality of programming
  - you need to build for real developers (99% developers)
- “Trickle-down” tooling is aspirational
  - myth: big tech pushes out tooling that smaller tech uses
  - reality: most companies don't hit FAANG scale, don't need FAANG tech to solve their problems
  - what to do: realize diff scale companies have different needs
- There is no gold standard development environment
  - myth: there exists a gold standard dev env
  - reality: developer-influencers tell stories, and don't show the whole truth
  - what to do: be more critical in asking for the truth
- The goal is progress, not perfection
  - myth: there's an ideal technology out there to solve all your problems
  - reality: teams don't know where to start on improving code quality
  - what to do: recognize incremental progress as valuable, but it doesn't need to be perfect
- A good demo doesn’t show the Day 2 snags
  - myth: you can see all sides of a product in a demo
  - reality: teams commit to tools after minutes, but use them for years
    - many tools are not effective until they are fully adopted
  - what to do: don't just buy the hype, recommend tools based on the less "sexy" dimensions
    - e.g. how does the tool integrate with existing workflows, how do they reduce friction within and outside teams
- Heterogeneity is here to stay
  - myth: there is one tool in someone else's stack that does it all
  - reality: everything and everybody is heterogeneous in their tech stack
  - what to do:
    - accept slow migrations
    - accept legacy subsystems
