- key features of a CEO presentation
  - Where are we now (timeline of major events/launches and numbers at the highest level of abstraction so that the exec doesn’t get bogged down by details)
  - Where do we want to be (3 year vision or why should someone put money/resources on this)
  - How will we reach there
- questions to answer
  - Why should the CEO put X million on this new initiative vs using the same resources somewhere else.
  - How does this new initiative tie to the mission of the company/something the CEO cares about.
- key takeaway: You are not presenting, you are selling.
