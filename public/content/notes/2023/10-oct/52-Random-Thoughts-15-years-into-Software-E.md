### Random Thoughts
- debuggability is highly underrated
- projects are late a lot
- aggressively manage (project) scope
- staging is pretty much always broken
- action is rewarded, pointing out problems/complaining is not
- take ownership of your systems
- you're part of a larger organization
- ask dumb questions
- you won't have time to go back and fix technical debt
- enjoy :)
