- a more holistic approach is better to help people reach their potential
  - this is what differentiates mentoring from coaching
- share your stories
  - Starting question: “Tell me your story. Start at the beginning and take your time — 20 or 30 minutes. I may ask a few questions, and everything you say will be confidential between us. Then, when you’re finished, I’ll tell you my story if you want me to.”
    - include personal details to demo that all aspects of life are on the table
- ask good questions
  - what keeps you up at night?
  - Can you see yourself being stimulated and fulfilled on your current career path for the next five years?
  - What do you do to “reboot” so that the busyness and tech overload in your life does not result in burnout?
  - Who has been most influential in your life?
  - What did you love doing in high school?
  - What would you have done differently in your life if you had the chance?
  - MA: this is a blurry article and getting into like, talk therapy levels of personal detail lol
- start with the end in mind
  - ask mentee: How do you personally define long-term success?
    - this can be a key question in guiding the relationship
- teach them how to fish
  - ask questions to help mentee id the real problems, and build courses of action
- unpack the mentee's toolkit
  - help them recognize and utilize their innate aptitudes
- most mentoring is caught not taught
  - how you serve as a role model is as important as the conversations
