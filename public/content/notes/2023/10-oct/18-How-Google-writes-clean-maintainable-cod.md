### What is “readability” exactly?
- To merge a PR @ Google, you need to get at least one review and approval from someone who:
  - Owns the code
  - Has “readability” of the languages used in the changelist
  - Is not you

### Benefits of Google’s readability process
- Keeps the codebase readable, searchable, and predictable.
- Increases knowledge sharing. 
- Enforces best practices.
  - For engineers, this forcing function makes best practices and style while coding a habit.
- Gets engineers used to reading code.
- Teaches you the ins and outs of a language.
- Sustains a culture of mentorship.


### Drawbacks of the process
- Slows down velocity 
- Subject to human bias.
- Hard to scale since its completely human based.

### What do ex-googlers think?
- positive: readability standards and style guide make it easy to do code review without sounding hostile
- negative: readability process is too heavyweight and a hindrance

### Is the process necessary?
- Google is making a tradeoff here between velocity and code quality
- Code quality != business outcomes
  - Amazon, Apple, and most tech companies have differing code quality across teams.
- Code quality is subjective
  - There’s a balance to be found and it’s very dependent on team and org culture.
