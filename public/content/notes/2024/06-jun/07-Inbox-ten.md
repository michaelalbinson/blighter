- Your ability to be effective is a function of your ability to efficiently ingest the information around you.
- In information work the cardinal sin is to block another team
- You cannot allow the urgent to overtake the important though - your work needs to come first
- Tips
  - 1/ Have A System for managing your communication across all channels - properties of this system:
    - You feel well informed and rarely hear new information secondhand.
    - If you do get information later than would have been useful, you debug what channel you weren’t in and amend your systems to prevent it from happening again.
    - You feel the communication you consume is high signal and reading it is a good use of time.
    - If you have just consumed information that is noisy, figure out how to eliminate it from that channel in the future. Do this in real time as the action to be taken on that item. You can unsubscribe, set up inbox rules, or give feedback to the author.
    - You instinctively know what channel to use to send a message given your goal and audience.
    - If you aren’t getting timely responses or thoughtful ones you may need to reconsider. But also do not abuse high urgency channels like chat when the content does not merit it.
    - You feel in control of your time and attention and you don’t allow others to hijack it.
    - You confidently redirect them to the proper channel. For example I often respond to chat messages that are not urgent with a simple “Thanks, please email this to me and I’ll take a look.”
  - 2/ Know your role and set expectations.
    - If you are the decision maker then you can either make a decision or ask for more information that you require to be able to do so.
    - If you aren’t the decision maker then you should supply any additional commentary you have as quickly as possible so that person has full context.
    - If the decision maker is not on the thread you should either add them or do whatever you can to unblock getting it to them. * If you aren’t sure who is the decision maker, then that is the first thing to clarify.
    - Even the best system can be overwhelmed during busy times, and at those times it can be helpful to send short expectation setting responses so people understand the timeline you are working on. Something as simple as “I’ll get to this by the end of the week” can help people plan effectively.
    - If you are constantly overwhelmed, but you feel your system is working as effectively as possible, then you need to either delegate more or ask your manager for help.
  - 3/ Be proactive but not formulaic.
    - it is beneficial to be more proactive in sending out thoughtful communication to a consistent group of peers to ensure you are all on the same page
    - if you don’t have anything new to say or a new way to say it then don’t bother/don't engage
- One of the most important tools you can use, regardless of channel, is to just decline to engage
