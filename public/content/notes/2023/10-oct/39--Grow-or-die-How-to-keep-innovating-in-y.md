### How to approach learning + exploration
- first, create a map
  - aim for breadth, not depth
  - over time, prioritize and drop some things to go deeper on others
  - talk to lots of people about what's going on
- untrue assumption: if you are successful today, doing more quantity, more efficiently, more consistently], you will be more successful tomorrow
  - it's hard to drop something to try something new, but it's important to continue your growth

### How to make time to explore
- you need a system
  - example: Bezos' regret minimization framework
  - A/B testing
    - try mini tests in your day-to-day actions
    - if successful, keep doing them
    - if not, drop them
  - Googleâ€™s 20% rule
    - fine balance: 1hr of your time, 1hr of company time every day
- the explorer strategy
  - balance the explore-exploit tradeoff
  - career advancement isn't luck, it's a deliberate choice/effort with a system behind it
