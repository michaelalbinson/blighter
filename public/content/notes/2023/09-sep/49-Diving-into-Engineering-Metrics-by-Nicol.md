- What are Engineering Metrics
  - quality
  - efficiency
  - operational efficiency
  - collaboration/team dynamics
  - reliability
  - technical health
  - product performance
  - dev experience
- Purpose of eng metrics
  - understand team performance
  - improve over time
  - support decision making
  - align with business goals
  - set and track goals
  - communicate progress
  - boost morale
  - optimize resources
  - ensure quality
- historic eng metrics + productivity
  - OG (50's): SLOC (source lines of code)
  - early 90's: velocity - amount of work delivered
  - late 90's: cycle time
  - 2014-2022: DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment)
    - Lead time for changes
    - deployment frequency
    - change failure rate
    - mean time to recovery
  - 2021: SPACE
    - (developer) satisfaction
    - performance
    - activity
    - communication/collaboration
    - efficiency and flow
  - 2023: DevEx
    - flow state
    - feedback loops
    - cognitive load
- Making the most of engineering metrics
  - stick with system metrics: e.g. latency/downtime/response time
  - team metrics are better than individual metrics
  - don't use metrics to blame people
  - regularly review and adjust
  - educate your team
  - keep it simple
- and remember: metrics aren't everything
