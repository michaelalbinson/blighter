Ask:
- How many weeks longer will future projects take when this refactoring is not undertaken?
- How much operating and development cost can we save in the future by refactoring these parts?
- What features will be impossible in the future if that part is not refactored?

Provide options for refactoring:
- Monster refactoring: a massive one-off refactoring project for months
- Refactor as you go: refactoring the bits and pieces when you next touch them
- Slice and dice: extract and isolate small parts to refactor them bit by bit

Get a second opinion - this can help convince your manager and yourself it makes sense to go forward with the refactor
