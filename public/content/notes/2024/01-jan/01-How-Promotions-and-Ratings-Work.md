steps:
- Self-review - you write an exhaustive list of all the impact you’ve had in the last 6-12 months
- Peer reviews - peers you requested feedback from write and submit it
- Your manager writes your review - your manager aggregates everything and proposes a rating for you
- Performance discussions (“calibrations”) - Your manager presents your review to the group of managers who make the final call. Your rating may change from what your manager proposed 
 

Takeaways for Engineers:
- your manager doesn’t have full control; they are just the messenger
- It’s helpful to have higher-up engineers and managers vouching for you
- Understanding the process can help you structure your self-reviews
