    - too many believe that it’s a binary choice between IC and mananger, that you’re locked into a path once you’ve started on it. In reality, the skills required to succeed are more connected than you think 
    - focus on learning instead of worrying about tracks and career ladders - that way, no matter what path you take you’ll only get better over time
- advice for early ICs
  - don't skipping engineering fundamentals to pivot into other roles prematurely
  - don't move on from a team or company too quickly
  - don;t chase the latest trend
  - ask these questions:
    - How can I make every code change a great one?
    - How can I be as good at [X] as [this person] on my team?
      - mentors come in all shapes and sizes
- tech leads, soak up all you can to build a strong foundation regardless of your future path

    - How can I transfer knowledge to the people around me and lay out a strategy for future generations?

    - How can I help my teammates grow, across all experience levels and scenarios?
- advice for leading organizations
  - many leaders convince the reluctant to become or stay managers, drafting them into duty
    - keeping unwilling managers in roles for too long is a costly mistake
  - questions

    - Am I spending time with my teams in the right way?
      - don’t let gathering information take you too deeply into the weeds
- takeaways
  - Strive to be the most valuable, but least critical. Think about how long you could be away from your team and how far off course they would get. Do everything you can to close that gap.
  - Focus on growth and learning at every step — not on climbing the ladder as quickly as possible. Don’t move on from a role too quickly, and try not to get caught up in chasing the latest trends.
  - The best engineers can toggle back and forth between manager and IC roles. Make sure your technical foundation and fundamental skills are solid enough to pull that off.
  - Do your homework before signing on to become a manager, and try your best to prepare for the emotional ups and downs coming your way.
  - If you’re a new manager, focus on the health and impact of your team, not on how much code you’re personally shipping.
  - Before you request additional headcount, drill down into why your team exists and how you can help every engineer level up.
  - Don’t lose the forest for the trees when you’re leading a large org. Dig in enough to understand what’s going on, but focus your contributions on where they’ll matter most.
