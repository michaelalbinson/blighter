- rendering strategies
  - pre-render everything (static rendering/static site generation)
    - ideal use cases:
      - infrequent changes
      - site layouts
      - perf-critical marketing pages
      - documentation sites/sites that are quick to rebuild
    - benefits
      - fast loads
      - good for SEO
      - reduced server load
      - low infra costs
    - drawbacks
      - increased build times
      - content updates require rebuilds
  - incremental static revaidation
    - ideal use cases:
      - when builds with static site generation are too long
      - ecommerce product pages
      - new websites
      - large-scale content sites
    - benefits
      - fast loads once page is built + cached
      - allows for on-demand content updates w/o full rebuild
      - scales to large numbers of pages
      - more cost-efficient than SSR
    - drawbacks
      - carefully manage cache invalidation strategy
    - best practice
      - favor on-demand vs time-based revalidation - timers make for bad cache flush indicators
      - use static loading skeletons
  - server-side rendering
    - ideal for:
      - when you are already revalidating ISR for most user requests (e.g. you need fresh data)
      - personalized pagres (dashboards, social media feeds, real-time data visualization)
    - benefits
      - always-fresh data
      - better for SEO and data load time
    - drawbacks
      - slower than SSG or ISR
      - time to first byte can be lacking
      - consumes more server resources
  - client-side rendering
    - ideal for:
      - user interactins with elements on the page that need immediate feedback
      - admin dashboards w/ real time data
      - ongoing background tasks after initial load
    - benefits
      - highly interactive UX
      - seamless transitions between app states
      - real-time interactions with data
    - drawbacks
      - inital load can be slower due to large JS bundles
      - optimizing core web vitals can be challenging
      - requires careful client state management
  - partial prerendering
    - ideal for:
      - instant page load
      - seamless stream of dynamic data (augmented SSR)
      - improved performance with less dev overhead
    - considerations
      - hard to opt in
