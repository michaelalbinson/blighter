- Clean code is not always the best code
- obsession over clean code can lead to
  - eroding trust with original code author
  - you will trade off "cleanliness" for flexibility if you optimize too early
- litmus tests:
  - can you name concrete engineering outcomes associated with the change?
  - how do your changes affect code modifications or future additions
- don’t be a clean code zealot
- clean code is not a goal - It’s an attempt to make sense out of complexity of systems you’re dealing with
