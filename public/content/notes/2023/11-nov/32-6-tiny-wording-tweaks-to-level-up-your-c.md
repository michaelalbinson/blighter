- Use “Would you be open to” instead of “Can you” when you want to seem less commanding but still lead to a “yes.”
- Add “because” to your reasoning or request to strengthen it.
- Use “can we” instead of “can you” to be more collaborative, particularly in code reviews.
- Use “What do you think” to assert a suggestion but still leave it open for discussion.
- Use “It seems like” when the conversation is at a stalemate and you want to call it out directly. Many times this breaks the stalemate.
- Change the order of your “but” to negate the part you actually want to negate.
