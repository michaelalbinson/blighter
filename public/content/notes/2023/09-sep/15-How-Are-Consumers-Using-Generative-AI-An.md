- ranking of web traffic to see the top 50 GenAI products
- takeaways
  - most leading products are built from the ground up around GenAI
    - majority didn't exist a year ago
    - 48% are bootstrapped with no funding
    - 3 way split between companies that
      - trained their own proprietary model
      - fine tuned an existing model
      - built a UI on top of an existing model ("GPT wrappers")
  - ChatGPT has a lead for now
    - 60% of traffic of the whole top 50 list
    - Character AI is second at 21%
  - LLM assistants are dominant; companionship (e.g. character AI) + creative (e.g. midjourney) tools are on the rise
  - early winners have emerged, but there's no moat in most product categories
    - starting to see fragmentation in purpose-built products for specific use cases
  - acquisition for top products is organic - consumers are willing to pay
    - most monetizing via a subscription model
  - Mobile apps are still emerging as a GenAI platform
    - only 15 companies on the list currently have a live mobile app
    - expect to see more mobile-first GenAI products emerge as the technology matures
