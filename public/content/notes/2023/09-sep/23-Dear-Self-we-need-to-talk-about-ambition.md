TL;DR: prose expression of the challenges of ambition in the transition from academia to working life.
It's pretty nihilistic. Not a huge fan, but I've saved some pertinent aspects below.


### Interesting snippets
> Creating your own definition of success feels scary; enacting it feels impossible. The fact that 
> school lays out neat little hoops for you to jump through is a feature.


> a lot of people shouting “be ambitious!” and “be independent!”. And because they shout it so 
> loudly and frequently you will think “surely, now I am in a wide open world and not on a path”.

### Some specific advice
- Plans don’t have to route through employment 
  - Giving up would have been easier if you’d separated giving up on loving programming or succeeding in the career from funding your life via programming
- You can fake ambition
  - What do you feel when you think about shrinking the project? 
    - Anger/feer/disappointment = seems like you care a lot, a good sign for the project
    - Relief: consider if you're up for the work before starting
    - Fear of failure: bad sign
    - Fear of other people's reactions: your motivation is solical, do you still want to go forward?
  - If you fail, will it be educational?
    - No = sign project is too big
  - How does concrete, accurate, actionable criticism make you feel? 
    - if it's a real goal that's important to you, you should be excited
  - Does the project give you a satisfying feeling of contact with reality?
    - Yes: good sign it's a real goal to you

- Sometimes procrastination is a workers’ strike
  - consider you may just not want to do it and should quit

- Your taste will always exceed your ability
  - so things you make will always be disappointing relative to the image in your head
