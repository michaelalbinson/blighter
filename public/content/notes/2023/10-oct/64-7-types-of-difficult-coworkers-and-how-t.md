Risk-averse: The Habitual Defender
- Working with them is good for you.
- Clearly describe the risk and how you plan to address it

Risk-taker: The Trailblazer
- Help them brainstorm. Ask them targeted questions and flesh out a more detailed plan with them.

The Stealthy Critic
- Make sign-off explicit.
- Follow up with them on unresolved comments.
- Have a 1:1 with them to go over their concerns and document it.

Opinionated and talkative
- Politely redirect the focus of the conversation. Acknowledge and thank them for their suggestions.
- Preemptively call out what is not in scope.

The Perfectionist
- Have a respectful 1:1 with them about their feedback. Describe the impact and ask how you can work better together.
- Define standards and a definition of done upfront.
- Ask explicitly if their feedback is a blocker.

Unmotivated
- Have a heartfelt 1:1 with them. Ask how you can support them.
- Let your manager know what you’re seeing.

The Overwhelmed Optimist
- Be understanding of their situation. They are already overwhelmed.
- Give examples of what you’ve noticed in a 1:1 and share the impact. Offer help.
- If it persists, bring it up with your manager.
