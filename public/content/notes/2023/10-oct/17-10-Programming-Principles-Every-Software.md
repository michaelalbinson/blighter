### Principles
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
  - avoid duplicating code in your programs and instead strive to write reusable and modular code
- KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid)
  - keep code and solutions as simple as possible
- YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
  - avoid adding unnecessary features or functionality to our code
- Separation of Concerns (SoC)
  - different parts of a program should focus on doing one thing well, without getting tangled up with unrelated tasks
- Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work
  - find the most straightforward and minimalistic approach that fulfills the immediate requirements
- Code For The Maintainer
  - writing code in a way that makes it easy for other developers to understand, modify, and maintain it in the future
- Avoid Premature Optimization 
  - prioritize writing clean and functional code before focusing on performance optimization
- Boy Scout Rule
  - making small, incremental changes whenever you work with it - leave it better than you found it
- Law of Demeter
  - minimize the coupling between different parts of a software system
- SOLID Principles
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    - class or module should have only one reason to change
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    - software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    - any instance of a class should be able to be used in place of its parent class without causing unexpected behavior
  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    - clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    - high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
