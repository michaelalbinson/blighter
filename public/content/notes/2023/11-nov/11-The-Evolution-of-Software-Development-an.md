## The History
### Early Days (1970s)
- languages: assembly languages and early high-level languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, and C
- dev process: ad hoc with limited formal structure
- teams: small, often consisting of a few individuals who were both developers and operators

### Structured Programming + PC Revolution (1980s)
- languages: emerging object-oriented languages like C++
- dev process: intro of structured programming and early SDLC models
- teams: growing in size, with more specialization among roles

### The Internet and Open Source Movement (1990s)
- languages: Java and Python; open-source languages gain popularity.
- dev process: waterfall methodology dominates; early agile and iterative approaches
- teams: increasingly complex

### Agile + the rise of web apps (2000s)
- languages: consolidation around a few key languages (Java, C#, JavaScript)
  - beginning of web-focused languages and frameworks
- dev process: agile methodologies become mainstream; focus on continuous delivery
- teams: multidisciplinary teams with close collaboration between dev, QE, and business stakeholders

### Devops + Cloud Computing (2010s)
- languages: Go and Swift; heavy focus on JavaScript frameworks for web development
- dev process: DevOps practices integrate development and operations; widespread adoption of cloud computing
- teams: more automation and tooling; emphasis on continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)

### AI, ML and remote work (2020s)
- languages: Consolidation around JavaScript and its frameworks, AI/ML work in Python
- dev process: AI-augmented coding tools; shift to microservices and serverless architectures
- teams: cross functional teams focused on product features; increase in AI-assisted development

## Filling the gaps
### Software dev lifecycles
#### Waterfall
- linear process following the concept, design, build, and deploy approach
- actors
  - stakeholders/PM - focus on product strategy
  - engineering manager: manages eng team, ensures efficient project execution
  - eng team: focus on product development

#### Agile
- two additional actors
  - product owners - represent the user and business needs w/i the dev team
  - scrum masters - coach for the team to follow "scrum" roles


## What's next
### For Engineering Managers
- Adopt Cross-Functional Training
- Focus on Soft Skills Development
- Facilitate Joint Goal Setting for both product and dev teams
- Implement Regular Cross-Team Meetings
- Promote User-Centric Development

### For Engineers
- develop product sensitivity
- participate in product strategy discussions
- adopt a T-shaped skillset
- improve communication skills
- understand the business and user perspective
