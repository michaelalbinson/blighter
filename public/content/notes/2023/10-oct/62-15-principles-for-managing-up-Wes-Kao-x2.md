- Embrace managing up.
  - managers are busy, help them help you
- Focus on the punchline.
  - give enough context and avoid back and forth follow ups
- Show your thought process.
  - this helps other people understand your logic/process/assumptions
- Flag potential issues.
  - and bring possible solutions
- Bring solutions, not complaints.
- Use information hierarchy.
  - recommendation, action item, or question at the top, then context below
- Keep your manager in the loop.
  - say what you're going to do
  - do it
  - tell your manager you're doing it
  - tell your manager you did it
- Are you being micromanaged, or do you need to communicate better?
  - ask why they're feeling the need to micromanage
- Over-communication might be the right amount.
  - over communitcate until people tell you to dial it back
- Proactively assert what to do.
  - provide supporting arguments for your recommendation
- Donâ€™t only ask questions. Share your point of view too.
  - form a point of view first, present it, and ask for counterarguments/beliefs
- Anticipate questions.
  - think of what stakeholders will ask before they ask
- Know when to get out.
  - managing up doesn't solve systemic problems/toxic management
- Be explicit about what you need.
  - be specific about what you're trying to get out of an interaction
- Expect to manage up forever.
  - it's part of a healthy relationship with peers/management
