-----------------------

- when joining a new team, make note of every time something makes you go wtf
- for two weeks - just write things down
- examples
  - not making notes of action items
  - tests not running locally
  - chunks of builds are always red
  - only one person can do critical, time-sensitive work
  - team is working on something but can't explain why it's important or how it'll help the customer
- reasons to cross things off the list
  - there's actually a good reason for it
  - team is already working on a fix
  - the team doesn't care about it
  - it's really easy to fix (then fix it)
- once you've eliminated as many as you can, discuss with team lead and manager
- ask about why the things on the list are as they are
- reasons why things may be on the list
  - team hasn't noticed
  - team has gotten used to it
  - problem is new, old problem it replaced was worse
  - they don't know how to fix the problem
  - they tried to fix the problem and failed
- tldr: park impulsive wtf thoughts first, then gather context before acting
