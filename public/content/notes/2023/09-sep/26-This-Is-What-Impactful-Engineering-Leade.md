- What It Means to Directly Support a Team
  - if you're a tech mgr your job is to support humans
  - two things to think about
    - People's day-to-day
      - make sure that everyone is happy, productive and engaged in their work
      - balance a structured weekly routine with having the unallocated time to give and receive feedback in real-time
    - their year-to-year
  - growth
    - for engineers, one way to increase your impact is to architect and own increasingly complex technical problems
    - if you can help the people on your team grow their individual capacity, you'll be able to get exponentially more done
    - empower tech leads to make decisions on their own
    - Maintain balance between more and less experienced engineers working together and regularly sharing knowledge
- Accelerate People with the Right Tools and Process
  - guardrails come in the form of:
    - the right environment
      - procuring the right tools, balancing feature work vs tech debt
      - smooth onboarding
    - regular check-ins
      - architecture review process
      - generalize the areas that could benefit everyone, and use the time saved to provide personalized attention
      - transparency is important here - team should feel invested in direction of the company
    - organic motivation
      - help engineers see their work through the lens of their impact on the company
      - recognize hard work, especially if it's not flashy
