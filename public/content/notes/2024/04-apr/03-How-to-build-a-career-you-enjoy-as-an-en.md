- Take Control of What You Can
  - if you’re working on a project no one knows exists, it’s not a good project to be working on.
- Avoid Snacking
  - Snack = Low impact, low effort
  - Quick win = High impact, low effort
  - Impactful project = High impact, high effort
- Make Sure You Work On What Matters
  - dimensions to focus on
    - Team or company impact
    - What you’re good at
    - What you’re passionate about
  - find a balance between these three dimensions
- Double Down - And Don’t Get Distracted
  - maintain your expertise and expand your scope
