### How to influence and think like a Staff Engineer
- joining a new team
  - get curious about tech, people, history of team
  - join social channels
  - start 1:1s with people to build relationships
  - remind self you're here with fresh eyes - ask lots of questions about things that don't make sense
- suggestions + influence
  - ask a lot of "what do you think" - and listen
  - don't fall into the trap of thinking you're completely right
  - as a tech lead you know some of what others know, but you don't know everything
  - some tips
    - assume best intent
    - do research - some issues are due to tooling, others to time constraints
    - determine if it's worth it to press an issue
    - find what you're missing
    - frame the resolution to their goals
    - make it easy
  - if you see something to be improved add it to a to-do list if it's not the right time
- difficult coworkers
  - use situation-behavior-impact framework - show impact on you, teammates, other people
  - assume best intent
  - surprising someone with feedback can feel like an ambush
- handling repeat issues
  - go to the manager as a last resort

### How to “manage your manager” effectively and handle disagreements
- managing up
  - try to avoid asking for too many small things/things you could solve yourself
  - manager is just another person with another role, treat them like a person, not someone you just need stuff from


### What differentiates a Staff Engineer from a Senior Engineer
- staff eng vs sr
  - staffs change the way the team works
  - staff improve some core infra
  - staff deliver high-quality products consistently
